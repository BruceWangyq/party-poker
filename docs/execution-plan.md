## 📱 User Flow

### Creating a Game
1. User opens app → "Create Room"
2. Set game parameters (blinds, buy-in, max players)
3. Generate 6-digit code + QR code
4. Share code/QR with friends
5. Wait in lobby for players to join
6. Start game when ready

### Joining a Game
1. User opens app → "Join Room"
2. Enter 6-digit code OR scan QR code
3. Enter nickname
4. Join lobby
5. Wait for host to start game

### Gameplay Flow
1. **Pre-game**: Seat assignment, initial chip distribution
2. **Hand Loop**:
   - Deal cards (2 hole cards per player)
   - Betting round 1 (pre-flop)
   - Deal flop (3 community cards)
   - Betting round 2
   - Deal turn (1 card)
   - Betting round 3
   - Deal river (1 card)
   - Final betting round
   - Showdown and winner determination
3. **Next hand**: Rotate blinds, repeat

## 🛠️ Development Stack

### iOS Development
- **Language**: Swift 5.9+
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Reactive Programming**: Combine
- **Networking**: URLSession + WebSocket
- **QR Code**: AVFoundation (camera), CoreImage (generation)
- **Persistence**: CoreData or UserDefaults

### Backend Services
- **Real-time Database**: Firebase Firestore

## 🎮 Game Rules Implementation

### Texas Hold'em Rules
- **Players**: 2-8 players
- **Cards**: Standard 52-card deck
- **Blinds**: Small blind (half big blind), big blind
- **Betting**: Check, call, raise, fold, all-in
- **Hand Rankings**: High card → Royal flush

### Technical Implementation
```swift
enum HandRank: Int, CaseIterable {
    case highCard = 1
    case pair = 2
    case twoPair = 3
    case threeOfAKind = 4
    case straight = 5
    case flush = 6
    case fullHouse = 7
    case fourOfAKind = 8
    case straightFlush = 9
    case royalFlush = 10
}
```

## 📊 Data Models

### Core Models
```swift
struct Room {
    let id: String
    let code: String
    let hostId: String
    var players: [Player]
    var gameState: GameState
    var settings: RoomSettings
}

struct Player {
    let id: String
    let nickname: String
    var chips: Int
    var cards: [Card]
    var position: Int
    var isActive: Bool
}

struct GameState {
    var phase: GamePhase
    var communityCards: [Card]
    var pot: Int
    var currentPlayer: String
    var blinds: (small: Int, big: Int)
}
```
